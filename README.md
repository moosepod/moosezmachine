# moosezmachine

moosezmachine is a Python implementation of a Z-Machine (Z-code interpreter) based off the Z-Machine Standards Document (http://inform-fiction.org/zmachine/standards/z1point1/index.html)

This project is a reference implementation -- no effort has been put into optimizations. 

Currently it only handles v4 and v5 files.
